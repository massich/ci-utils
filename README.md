CI-utils
========

This repository contains a collection of scripts for Continuous Integration (CI)
that we use across Openmeeg repositories.
Its main purpose is to provide all our projects with a common manner to install
their dependencies, but using a script archive rather than copy pasting bits and
pieces in CI's config files provide also two main advantages:

- a natural manner for more comprehensive scripting.
- documenting the installation process.
